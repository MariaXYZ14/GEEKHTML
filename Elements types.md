## SEMANTIC ELEMENTS

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Block elements are meant to structure the main parts of your page, by dividing your content in coherent blocks wth full width.

## non-SEMANTIC ELEMENTS

Inline elements are meant to differentiate part of a text, to give it a particular function or meaning. Inline elements usually comprise a single or few words.
